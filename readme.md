You can read why this workflow exists [here](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/meta/my-mind.html). 

Essentially you can search through entirety of [my wiki](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/), all of [my mind maps](https://my.mindnode.com/myLVaRLKytoTYBLshxGzzb75MN9cyGHbQBgaVVPp#323.6,381.4,3) which include super fast access to various books, courses, blogs, research papers, reddit subreddits, stack exchange sites and more that I use to move and learn things faster.

As this workflow is focused and optimised for fast access to all the knowledge and references I have indexed. It would make sense to read through the wiki I made and maintain [here](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) first.

My goals with sharing both this workflow and my [wiki knowledge base](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) is to extend my idea of of [knowledge bootstrapping](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/knowledge-bootstrapping-36c97e0dee19#.udmp9eotg) and tapping into a person's expertise in the most transparent way possible.

## Install 
Download the workflow from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind/releases/latest).

## Contribute 
This workflow heavily leverages curated lists from [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) that can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-anything). You can contribute directly to those lists so everyone benefits. 

In the future, I hope to expose certain lists as CSV files that all can contribute and add to similar to [Web Searches workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches).
