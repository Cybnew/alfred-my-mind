You can read why this workflow exists [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/opening-up-my-mind-%EF%B8%8F-575c8ece8a24). 

Essentially you can search through entirety of [my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz), all of [my mind maps](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/meta/my-mind.html) which include super fast access to various books, courses, blogs, research papers, reddit subreddits, stack exchange sites and more that I use to move and learn things faster.

As this workflow is focused and optimised for fast access to all the knowledge and references I have indexed. It would make sense to read through the wiki I made and maintain [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) first.

My goals with sharing both this workflow and my [wiki knowledge base](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) is to extend my idea of [knowledge bootstrapping](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/knowledge-bootstrapping-36c97e0dee19#.udmp9eotg) and tapping into a person's expertise in the most transparent way possible.

## Installing
Download the workflow from [GitHub releases](../../releases/latest).

## Contributing
[Suggestions](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind/issues) and pull requests are highly encouraged!

This workflow heavily leverages curated lists from [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) that can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/Curated-Lists). You can contribute directly to those lists so everyone benefits. 

## Developing
If you want to add features and things to the workflow. I advise you to install [this Alfred CLI tool](https://godoc.org/github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred) by running:

`go install github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred`

You can then make your changes to the code and then run `alfred build` inside this repo to build the go binary to `workflow` directory. Which you can then use from Alfred script filters.
