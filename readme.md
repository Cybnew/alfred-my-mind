# Description

You can read why this workflow exists in an article [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/opening-up-my-mind-%EF%B8%8F-575c8ece8a24). ✍🏻

Essentially you can search through all of the notes, bookmrks I myself use as well as blogs, github users, images, research papers and more that I use to move and learn things faster.
