<h1 align="center"> Description 📕</h1>

You can read why this workflow exists [here](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/meta/my-mind.html). 

Essentially you can search through entirety of [my wiki](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/), all of [my mind maps](https://my.mindnode.com/myLVaRLKytoTYBLshxGzzb75MN9cyGHbQBgaVVPp#618.3,-10.4,-1) which include super fast access to various books, courses, blogs, research papers, reddit subreddits, stack exchange sites and more that I use to move and learn things faster.

Since this workflow is geared for my own personal use and productivity and in many ways tries to act as an extension of my brain, it can at times be messy and is always in *work in progress* state.

As this workflow is focused and optimised for fast access to all the knowledge and references I have indexed. It would make sense to read through the wiki I made and maintain [here](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) first.

My goals with sharing both this workflow and my wiki knowledge base is to extend my idea of of [knowledge bootstrapping](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/knowledge-bootstrapping-36c97e0dee19#.udmp9eotg) and tapping into a person's expertise in the most transparent way possible.

<h1 align="center"> Install 💎</h1>

Download the workflow from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind/releases/latest).


<h1 align="center"> Contribute 💛</h1>

This workflow heavily leverages curated lists from [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) that can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-anything). You can contribute directly to those lists so everyone benefits. 

In the future, I hope to expose certain lists as CSV files that all can contribute and add to similar to [Web Searches workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches).
